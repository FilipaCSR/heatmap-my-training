## 🎓 How to Use

1. **Export your Apple Health data** from your iPhone:

   * Open the Health app → Profile → Export All Health Data  
   * Save the `.zip`, extract it, and locate the `export.xml`  
   * Full guide: [How to extract Apple Health data](https://medium.com/@filipacsr/how-to-extract-and-analyze-apple-health-data-with-r-7d28029d22bd)

2. **(Optional but recommended)** Filter the XML to reduce size and extract only relevant data:

   The file `filter_health_data.py` helps with this:
   ```bash
   python filter_health_data.py      --input export.xml      --output filtered_data.csv      --types HKWorkoutType HKQuantityTypeIdentifierDistanceWalkingRunning
   ```
   This creates a smaller CSV file focused on your training data.

3. **Run the app locally**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

   Or **upload to Streamlit Cloud** to share it online with a link.
